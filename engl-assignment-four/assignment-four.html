<div class="headline">CAMP for a Day Inspires Cape Henlopen Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA)</div>

<div class="byline">By senior Kimberly Stiles, Cape Henlopen GSA President</div>

<p>This past week, I traveled to CAMP Rehoboth, an LGBTQ+ resource center in Rehoboth Beach, with my fellow GSA club members to attend the program CAMP for a Day. The information and experience we walked away with is incomparable to high school inclusion and diversity training.<p>

<p>First, co-founder Murray Archibald gave a speech on the beginnings of CAMP Rehoboth and how it is working to connect to high schoolers to further spread comfort and safety for the LGBTQ+ community. The presentation featured audience interaction through Archibald calling on students to share experiences of discrimination in high school. This presentation was very engaging through its audience participation and Archibald’s timeline of CAMP Rehoboth’s journey, and it taught the GSA members more ways to spot exclusivity and ways to fight against it as students.</p>

<p>The next piece of CAMP for a Day was an activity where students discussed ways to make Cape Henlopen more inclusive through small group discussion. This activity was led by volunteer Marie Packer and each small group shared their ideas at the end for the large group discussion. The activity taught the GSA members that despite only being high school students, we can be advocates for our own safety and comfort in our school. Our members were very emotional during this activity, and it brought us closer together by allowing us to be vulnerable with each other. I greatly enjoyed this activity and I believe it gave our chapter a lot of good resources to bring back to our school. </p>

<p>Lastly, we were treated to cookies and chips and listened to a presentation by volunteer Amy Gerald about personal identity and how to preserve it through administrative paperwork, like changing a name that a student no longer uses to the name they are comfortable being addressed by. The presentation was engaging and taught the club members about different ways people identify and how they advocate for their personal safety and comfort. I believe our chapter will return to Cape Henlopen with new ways to address administration about preserving the safety and comfort of its LGBTQ+ students.</p>

<p>Our experience at CAMP Rehoboth was so valuable to the development of our GSA program through the educational presentations and engaging group discussions. I believe GSA chapters close to the city Rehoboth Beach consider attending CAMP for a Day to boost their programs and encourage activism in their high school community.</p>
